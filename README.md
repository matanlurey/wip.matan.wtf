I tend to not finish ideas, so I'm going to keep track of them here.

This micro "site"[^1]'s schema is defined in [`schema.json`](schema.json), and
the data is in [`data.json`](data.json). At some point, I'll write a simple CLI
to manage the data, and eventually generate a static site from it via GitHub
Actions.

TODO: Find tie-ins for <https://indieweb.org> and <https://microformats.org>.

[^1]: It's not really a site, but JSON that might generate a site someday.
